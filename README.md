### about me

hello, this is Kohane here, a computer science student from China. <ins>i write some code and do some user interface design</ins>. well, i am not so good at this stuff, i just flat out do what i think i want to do on my own.

i mostly do web frontend development, handling both design and coding by myself, and sometimes work on web backend development. i also use Swift to create small apple ecosystem software.

currently, i am mainly learning Rust and Go, and experimenting with building some embedded projects using the rust toolchain. on the other hand, i am also planning to learn some linux development.

### contacts

i'm a relatively quiet person, but i'm happy to talk with anyone, so if there's anything you'd like to talk to me about, you can get in touch with me through the following.

- [work e-mail: i@aimless.sh](mailto:i@aimless.sh)
